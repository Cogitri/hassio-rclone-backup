# Rclone Backup
Backup your Home Assistant configuration or snapshots to over 40 cloud providers using [Rclone](https://rclone.org/).

This pairs well with the custom integration [Auto Backup](https://github.com/ssiergl/hass-auto-backup) which provides a highly configurable way to create snapshots and have them deleted after a given period.

Rclone Backup can sync specific snapshots, e.g. snapshots starting with `AutoBackup*` to a cloud provider, and when that snapshot is deleted from Home Assistant it will be removed from the cloud provider as well.

You can also directly sync your Home Configuration e.g. `/config`, `/share`, `/ssl` to a cloud service or to another machine using SFTP. Rclone is smart and will only upload changed files.
